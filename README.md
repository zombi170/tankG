# tankG
The program displays a tank with its two tracks, body, turret, and cannon.
This was my fifth homework for the Graphics course at BME.

## Change the speed of the tracks
- 'o' - increase right track
- 'l' - decrease right track
- 'q' - increase left track
- 'a' - decrease left track

## Move the turret
- 'b' - left
- 'n' - right

## Move the cannon
- 'w' - up
- 's' - down
